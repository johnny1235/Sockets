I was able to successfully run all of the functions except IM from the client side.
I can also return the correct values from server to client. 

Unfortunely, I didn't have enough time to get to the IM function. I still need to display the query correctly or format it better.

I am sending a string with comma as a delimiter to seperate the list size and names. I'm not sure how to send a vector to client so I decided to send a big string if need be lol. I was thinking of using that string from the client size to create an array to better display the data? It may not be the best way but I'll trust your judgement haha.

Don't forget the - is the  delimiter for the client code
Example input: ./apple.out 127.0.0.1 3-jo-bobb888-1965.51.555-2 9000
apple.out is the complide code for client
a.out is for contactList.cpp
